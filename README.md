# hello-world
My first step in the right direction...
My parents named me "Inder Raj Singh Khokhar", pretty long, huh!?
My friends call me "Indu"
I am much like you my dear reader a small dot in the endless universe, waiting to make an impact... I hope one day to be the dot without which the figure cannot be constructed. 
Thanks for your time,stalker!
Yo!
